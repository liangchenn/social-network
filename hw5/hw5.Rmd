## Problem 1

### 1a.
Drop the effect of smoke1 similarity and estimate the model again.
Do this by the function setEffects() using the <<include>> parameter.
Give the changed effects object and the new answer object new names,
such as effects1 and ans1, to distinguish them.

```{r}
res1
```



### 1b.
Change the three effects of alcohol to the single effect
of alcohol similarity, and estimate again.


```{r}
res2
```


## Problem 2

### 2a.
Replace the average alter effect by average similarity (avSim)
or total similarity (totSim) and estimate the model again.

```{r}
NB_avSim
```

```{r}
NB_totSim
```



### 2b.
Add the effect of smoking on drinking and estimate again.

We could find the answer in `Rsiena` manual, using `effFrom` to add smoking effect on drinking.

```{r}
NB_with_smoke
```
